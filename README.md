# Numerical investigation of 1d Jellium model

This repository includes functions for exploring 1d jellium model in equilibrium. 

## Description
* Basic exploration:
    By running Basic_jellium_exploration.py, we find the average equilibrium density of the 1d jellium model with N particles. The result is obtained by using Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation.
    The plot of the density is saved as Figures/density.png.
    The plot of the system's energy as a function of algorithm steps is saved as Figures/Energy_to_equilibrium.png.

### Dependencies
Required packages are specified in Requirements.txt

### Executing program

#### Average density 
To find the average density of the jellium model, run:
```python3 Basic_jellium_exploration.py```
